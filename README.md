This project focuses on the classification of emotions from EEG brain signals through the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project's initial phase entails retrieving data from a CSV file, a process facilitated by the Pandas library. The dataset utilized for this project has been sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed at the following link: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/eeg-brainwave-dataset-feeling-emotions" has been thoughtfully structured to accommodate diverse emotional states, with categorical labels encompassing 'NEGATIVE,' 'NEUTRAL,' and 'POSITIVE.' This collection of EEG brainwave data has undergone meticulous statistical extraction, serving as a foundation for the subsequent analysis. It involves brain signal recordings obtained from male and female participants exposed to various scenes, including Emotional, Funny, Death, and Nature scenarios. These scenes were designed to evoke distinct emotional responses, capturing brain signals within the context of these specific environments. The primary objective of this project is to develop an effective CNN-based model capable of accurately classifying emotions based on EEG brain signals.
